# Watch Sloth

This sloth has your back!

# The Problem
With security systems these days is you don't actually know who is at your house. It could be your significant other coming over without telling you or a burglar. Why call the cops on your loved why?  That's where Watch Sloth comes in.

Watch Sloth will tell you via YO! who came in with a picture.  Be it a loved one or a burglar.  

This system is not only for people who own their own home but for a system of any scale.  Be it a single room that one is subleasing or an important safe or box, Watch Sloth can help protect you.
